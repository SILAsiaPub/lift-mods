Transformation Information.

This transformation takes a Fieldworks Language Explorer exported LIFT file and 
adds two features.

1. It allows ordering of gloss entries so you can choose the language to appear 
as the second language underneath the gloss.

2. It adds some fields to output semantic information. You can choose the label 
word for the semantic entry. You can add a lanuage like tab for semantic words 
and or semantic numbers.
