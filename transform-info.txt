Transformation Information.

This transformation takes a Fieldworks Language Explorer exported LIFT file and 
adds two features.

1. It allows ordering of gloss entries so you can choose the language to appear 
as the second language underneath the gloss.

2. It adds some fields to output semantic information. You can choose the label 
word for the semantic entry. You can add a lanuage like tab for semantic words 
and or semantic numbers.

To Use:

1. Export LIFT file from Fieldworks.
2. Place LIFT file in the same folder as transform.hta
3. Double click the transform.hta from Windows Explorer
4. Click the Edit Project button.
   a. Edit the project.txt file and put the LIFT file name as the infile.
   b. Name the outfile to a different name to the infile LIFT.
   c. Save and close the project.txt file
5. Click the Run Transformation button.
   If the black command window appears and dissappears that is good everything should have worked.
   If the black command window stays showing then there was a problem. Errors occured.
6. Use the created outfile LIFT file as your input for Dictionary App Builder.
